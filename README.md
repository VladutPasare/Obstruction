# Obstruction

Obstruction is a 2D game in which players take turns in marking squares on a grid. The first player unable to move loses (if there are no empty cells).

The application was developed in Python (client side) and C (server side). The players communicate with the server through a ```TCP``` connection.

## Features
- ```Human``` versus ```Computer``` mode (the blocks are randomly placed for the computer player)
- ```Multiplayer``` mode
- Graphical User Interface built with the ```Pygame``` library
