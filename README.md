# Obstruction

Obstruction is a 2D game in which players take turns in marking squares on a grid. The first player unable to move loses (if there are no empty cells).

The application was developed in Python (client side) and C (server side), with GUI implemented using the ```Pygame``` library. The players communicate with the server through a ```TCP``` connection.

In the single-player mode, the player can choose between two options for the opponent player (computer): either randomly for a more unpredictable challenge or using a ```Minimax Algorithm``` for a more strategic and competitive gameplay experience.
